# learning-journey
I am a 19-year-old student from South Africa
currently learning HTML and JavaScript through
FreeCodeCamp. I am looking forward
to contributing my mechanical logic and
discipline to a team.
I am a beginner. I have a very basic understanding of HTML.
I have just started learning JavaScript on FreeCodeCamp
and do not know how to write it yet. I am joining to
learn and am happy to do HTML, documentation, or basic tasks
while I observe the JS process.
